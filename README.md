### Summary
This software tool has been developed specifically to sort data for the Rigaku X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Often, the spreadsheets generated by QuantEZ can be poorly formatted and difficult to work with. Our tool addresses this problem by extracting the relevant data and reformatting it in a more user-friendly manner. It is important to note that this tool is provided on an "as-is" basis, without any warranty or guarantee of performance. Additionally, please be advised that we are not affiliated with Rigaku or any other company.
