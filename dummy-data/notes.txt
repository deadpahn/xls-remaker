- The data is real but nothing I've included could be used to figure out anything proprietary or confidential. I changed the sample names for example.

- The "DATA-0*" files are what the X-Ray software produce. Ultimately, I'd rather not assume a group of files would be sequentially named. But to start, if that makes it easier we can do this.

- Within the XLSX files produced by the software, the "Sample Name" is in a group of merged cells (annoying) and seems to have a tab character appended to it. If this makes it difficult to deal with, using the filename in the output would be acceptable I think.  

- Another annoying thing the software does is to store the numbers as text. Ideally, these would be converted to numbers in the output file, but it isn't too hard to fix all these errors in a couple clicks for one sheet in Excel.

- "ND" means Not Detected. If it makes things easier, these can just be blank cells. Please to not make them zero though. ND is different from zero. 

- I've added some shading to help you track where things come from in the DATA files in the mock output files. We do not need any shading in the real output files. 

- The "BATCH_OUTPUT" file is a mock of how I'd want the data to be compiled as a minimum viable option.

- The "BATH_OUTPUT_WITH_SORT" file would be a few steps more, sorting each data set by element in the compilation. This makes the spreadsheet much more ready for graphing results.

- LMK if you have any questions.
